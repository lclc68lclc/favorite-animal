	<p>This is not T'Challa we are talking about here. No, sir. This is the original black panther, also known as the melanistic color variant of the Panthera species. They are known as leopards in Asia and Africa and are called Jaguars in the Americans.</p>

	<p>The melanism allele, or the thing that makes them black, is dominant in Jaguars. They may produce spotted cubs. </p>
